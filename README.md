The Cartesi Rollups Node is the middleware that connects the Rollups smart contracts, the application back-end running inside the Cartesi Machine, and the front-end.

## Getting Started

### Installation

We provide packages for debian (.deb) in **amd64** and **arm64** variants on the release page. Other systems can build from source.

#### From Sources

##### System Requirements

- Cartesi Machine emulator == 0.19.x
- GNU Make >= 3.81
- Go >= 1.24.1

Follow the Cartesi Machine installation instructions [here](https://github.com/cartesi/machine-emulator?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

##### Build

```sh
# clone a stable branch of the emulator
git clone --branch v2.0.0 https://github.com/cartesi/rollups-node.git
cd rollups-node

# compile
make
```

### Install

Optionally setup `GO_INSTALL_PATH`, then:

```sh

# install
sudo make install
```

### Usage

Once installed, the node requires configuration to run.
Via either environment variables or execution arguments.

As an **example**, the development values can be found with `make env`.
Node operators should get familiar with those and customize to their specific setup.
For more on this topic, consult the [wiki](https://github.com/cartesi/rollups-node/wiki/Configuration).

The node provides multiple binaries, one for each of its modules (advancer, claimer, evm-reader, validator, jsonrpc-api).
They follow the naming convention `cartesi-rollups-<module>`.
In addition, there is the `cli` tool that provides functionality to help develop and debug the Cartesi Rollups node and
the `node` to run in standalone mode.

Each of these binaries has a help invokable with: `<binary> --help` for discoverability.
For more on this topic, consult the [wiki](https://github.com/cartesi/rollups-node/wiki/Commands).
